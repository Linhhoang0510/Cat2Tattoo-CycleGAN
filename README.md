# Cat2Tattoo CycleGAN

Massive thanks to https://machinelearningmastery.com/cyclegan-tutorial-with-keras/ for helping me complete this project

This project aims to leverage the power of CycleGAN in translating normal cat images to artistic tattoo-style cat photos

The inspiration comes from the fact that normal things can be combined to achieve things of our interests. Thus, by using CycleGAN, a model was built that can be very beneficial for tattoo enthusiasts who are looking for personalized tattoo designs. The reason for this is sometimes designs by tattoo artists can be very costly. This offers an innovative way of using Deep Learning to generate custom tattoos of peopleâ€™s pets or anything else that they love.
